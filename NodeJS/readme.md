# Node JS fundamentals #
For all of our projects in NodeJS we will use BotBuilder that has to be installed using npm

So for every bot we'll build we should should initialize the project typing the next command at the console:

```console
npm init
```

Once we initialized our project it is time to download and install botbuilder:

```console
npm install botbuilder
```
