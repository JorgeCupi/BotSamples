# BotSamples
This is personal repo for saving exercises done when learning how to use Bot Framework services on NodeJS and C#.
Most of the samples will heavily rely on the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bot-framework/overview-introduction-bot-framework">official documentation from Bot Framework</a> 

There are two folders:
- One for C# samples
- One for NodeJS samples
